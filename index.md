## About me

I am a second-year Ph.D. Student at the Interactive Intelligence Group at Delft University of Technology under the joint supervision of Prof. Frans Oliehoek and Prof. Matthijs Spaan. I am also a member of the [Mercury Machine Learning Lab](https://icai.ai/mercury-machine-learning-lab/) where I work under the supervision of Dr. Onno Zoeter.

I have obtained my MSc in Robotics, Systems, and Control from ETH Zurich (2021), and previously I graduated with a double degree in Automation Engineering from the University of Bologna (2018) and Tongji University (2019). During my Masters degree, I have also spent time at the Empirical Inference Department of Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (Tübingen) and Amazon (Berlin).

My research interstests are causality and sequential decision making. My current area of research is counterfactual learning, where I am focusing on off-policy reinforcement learning.
