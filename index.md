## About me

I am a first-year Ph.D. Student at the Interactive Intelligence Group at Delft University of Technology under the joint supervision of Dr. Frans A. Oliehoek and Dr. Matthijs Spaan. I am also a member of the Mercury Machine Learning Lab, a collaboration between Booking.com, Delft University of Technology, and the University of Amsterdam.

I have obtained my MSc in Robotics, Systems, and Control from ETH Zurich (2021), and previously I graduated with a double degree in Automation Engineering from the University of Bologna (2018) and Tongji University (2019). I have also spent time at the Empirical Inference Department of Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (TÃ¼bingen) and Amazon (Berlin).
