## About me

I am a second-year Ph.D. Student at the Interactive Intelligence Group at Delft University of Technology under the joint supervision of Prof. Frans Oliehoek and Prof. Matthijs Spaan. I am also a member of the [Mercury Machine Learning Lab](https://icai.ai/mercury-machine-learning-lab/) where I work under the supervision of Dr. Onno Zoeter.

I have obtained my MSc in Robotics, Systems, and Control from ETH Zurich (2021), and previously I graduated with a double degree in Automation Engineering from the University of Bologna (2018) and Tongji University (2019). During my Masters degree, I have also spent time at the Empirical Inference Department of Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (Tübingen) and Amazon (Berlin).
