## About me

I am a second-year Ph.D. Student at the Sequential Decision Making Group at Delft University of Technology under the joint supervision of [Prof. Frans Oliehoek](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=it&user=rSNBJJIAAAAJ) and [Prof. Matthijs Spaan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=it&user=twSIZSEAAAAJ). I am also a member of the [Mercury Machine Learning Lab](https://icai.ai/mercury-machine-learning-lab/), through which I am affiliated with Booking.com where I am a Machine Learning Scientist II, and I work under the supervision of Dr. Onno Zoeter.

I have obtained my MSc in Robotics, Systems, and Control from ETH Zurich (2021) with [Prof. Emilio Frazzoli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8JGG3KcAAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao) as tutor, and previously I graduated with a double degree in Automation Engineering from the University of Bologna (2018) and Tongji University (2019). During my Master's degree, I have also spent time at the Empirical Inference Department of Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (Tübingen) where I worked with [Frederik Träuble](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oc2OOyMAAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao) under the supervision of [Prof. Bernhard Schölkopf](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DZ-fHPgAAAAJ&hl=it), [Prof. Stefan Bauer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O-oICE8AAAAJ&hl=it) and [Dr. Francesco Locatello](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wQanfTIAAAAJ&hl=it), and at Amazon (Berlin) where I worked with [Dr. Sebastian Höfer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=it&user=srCW5e4AAAAJ).

My research interests are causality and sequential decision-making. My current area of research is counterfactual learning, where I am focusing on off-policy reinforcement learning.
